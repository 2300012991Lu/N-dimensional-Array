# N-dimensional-Array

In my VCL Final Project, I need to implement an n(arbitary, runtime-given)-dimensional array with L elements in each dimension (in cpp).

It's easy to think of allocating an one-dim array with $L^n$ elements. And then we need a method to describe index. It's also to think of using an vector with n elements to describe n indices of n dimensions.
